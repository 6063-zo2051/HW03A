# HOMEWORK 03 PART A

## SUMMARY
This code aims to create a Yayoi Kusama style image with large and small circles that repeat.

----

My initial plan was to create a repeating pattern of the large polka dots in one set of netsted for loops, and to then repeat this for the small dots in a seperate nest of loops. With a canvas of 400x400, I mentally split it into segments of 50 units to visualize. The hardest part thus far was figuring out my issue with the smaller dots, as they would not appear.
